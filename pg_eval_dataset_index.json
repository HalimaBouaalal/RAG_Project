        "node_0": "Monopoly Rules \n \nHISTORY\u2026 PARKER BROTHERS Real Estate Trading Game MONOPOLY\u00a9 was invented during the Great Depression by Charles \nB. Darrow of Germantown Pennsylvania. Mr. Darrow, like. many other Americans, was unemployed at the time and he worked out the \ndetails of the game primarily to amuse himself during this period. Prior to the Depression, Darrow and his wife vacationed in the resort \ntown of Atlantic City, New Jersey. When it came to naming the streets on the game board, Darrow naturally adopted those of his favorite \nvacation spot. \nThe first games were handmade. Darrow gave them to friends and sold a few through a Philadelphia department store. As the demand for \nthe game grew, Darrow could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to take over the game. \nSince 1935 when Parker Brothers acquired the rights to the game, it has become the leading proprietary game not only in the United States \nbut throughout the Western world. the game is published under license in twenty&SHY;five countries and in fifteen foreign languages. \n \nOBJECT...The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling property. \n \nEQUIPMENT...The equipment consists of a board, 2 dice, tokens 32 houses and 12 hotels. There are Chance and Community Chest \ncards, a Title Deed card for each property and play money. \n \nPREPARATION...Place the board on a table and put the Chance and Community Chest cards face-down on their allotted spaces on the \nboard. Each player chooses one token to represent him on his travels around the board. \n \nEach player is given $1500 divided as follows: 2 each of $500's, $100's and $50's; 6-$20's; 5 each of $10's, $5's and $1's. \nAll remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank. \n \nBANKER...Select as Banker a player who will also make a good Auctioneer. If the Banker plays in the game, he must keep his personal \nfunds separate from those of the Bank.",
        "node_1": "All remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank. \n \nBANKER...Select as Banker a player who will also make a good Auctioneer. If the Banker plays in the game, he must keep his personal \nfunds separate from those of the Bank. When more than five persons play, the Banker may elect to act only as Banker and Auctioneer. \n \nTHE BANK...Besides the Bank's money, the Bank holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase and use by the \nplayers. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells and auctions properties and hands out their proper Title Deed cards; it sells houses \nand hotels to the players and loans money when required on mortgages. \n \nThe Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of all properties which it sells and auctions.  \n \nThe Bank never \"goes broke\". If the Bank runs out of money it may issue as much more as may be needed by merely writing on any \nordinary paper. \n \nTHE PLAY... Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice. The player with the highest total starts the play. He places his \ntoken on the corner marked \"GO\", throws the 2 dice and moves his token in the direction of the arrow the number of spaces indicated by \nthe dice. After he has completed his play, the turn to play passes to the left. The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from \nthat point on the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same time. \n \nAccording to the space which his token reaches, a player may be entitled to buy real estate or other properties, -or be obliged to pay rent, \npay taxes, draw a Chance or Community Chest card, \"Go to Jail\", etc. \n \nIf a player throws doubles he moves his token as usual the sum of the two dice and is subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to \nthe space on which he lands. Retaining the dice, he throws again and moves his token as before. If a player throws doubles three times in \nsuccession, he moves his token immediately to the space marked \"In Jail\" (see JAIL).",

Retaining the dice, he throws again and moves his token as before. If a player throws doubles three times in \nsuccession, he moves his token immediately to the space marked \"In Jail\" (see JAIL). \n \n\"GO\"...Each time a player's token lands on or passes over \"GO\", whether by throw of the dice or by drawing a card, the Banker pays him \n$200 salary. \n \n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",
        "node_3": "However, $200 is paid only once each time around the board. If a player, passing \"GO\" on the throw of the dice, lands 2 spaces beyond it \non \"Community Chest\", or 7 spaces beyond it on \"Chance\", and draws the card \"Advance to GO\", he collects $200 for passing \"GO\" the \nfirst time and another $200 for reaching it the second time by instructions on the card. \n \nBUYING PROPERTY...Whenever a player lands on an unowned property he may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. \nHe receives the Title Deed card showing ownership and places it face-up in front of him.  \n \nIf he does not wish to buy the property it is sold at auction by the Banker to the highest bidder. The buyer pays to the Bank the amount of \nthe bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player, including the one who declined the option of buying it at the \nprinted price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price. \n \nPAYING RENT...When a player lands on property owned by another player the owner collects rent from him in accordance with the list \nprinted on the Title Deed card applying to it. \n \nIf the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a property is mortgaged its Title Deed card is placed face-down in front of \nthe owner. \n \nIt is an advantage to hold all the Title Deeds in a color-group (i.e.: Boardwalk and Park Place, - or Connecticut, Vermont and Oriental \nAvenues) because the owner may then charge double rent for unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to unmortgaged \nproperties even if another property in that color-group is mortgaged. \n \nIt is even more of an advantage to have houses or hotels on properties because rents are much higher than for unimproved properties. \n \nThe owner may not collect his rent if he fails to ask for it before the second player following throws the dice.  \n \n\"CHANCE\" and \"COMMUNITY CHEST\"...When a player lands on either of these spaces he takes the top card from the deck indicated, \nfollows the instructions and returns the card face-down to the bottom of the deck.",

If the player who draws it does not wish to \nuse it he may sell it, at any time, to another player at a price agreeable to both. \n \n\"INCOME TAX\"...When a player lands on \"Income Tax\" he has two options: he may estimate his tax at $200 and pay the Bank, or he \nmay pay 10% of his total worth to the Bank. His total worth is all his cash on hand, printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged \nproperties and cost price of all buildings he owns. \n \nThe player must decide which option he will take before he adds up his total worth. \n \nJAIL...A player lands in Jail when. . . (1.) his token lands on the space marked \"Go to Jail\"; (2.) he draws a card marked \"Go to Jail\"; (3.) \nhe throws doubles three times in succession.  \n \nWhen a player is sent to Jail he cannot collect $200 salary in that move since, regardless of where his token is on the board, he must move \nit directly into Jail. A player's turn ends when he is sent to Jail. \n \nIf a player is not \"sent to Jail\" but in the ordinary course of play lands on that space, he is \"Just Visiting\", incurs no penalty, and moves \nahead in the usual manner on his next turn. \n \nA player gets out of Jail by... (1.) throwing doubles on any of his next three turns. If he succeeds in doing this he immediately moves \nforward the number of spaces shown by his doubles throw.

This is just a \"free\" \nresting place. \n \nHOUSES...When a player owns all the properties in a color & SHY; group he may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those \nproperties. \n \nIf he buys one house, he may put it on any one of those properties. The next house he buys must be erected on one of the unimproved \nproperties of this or any other complete color-group he may own. \n \nThe price he must pay the Bank for each house is shown on his Title Deed card for the property on which he erects the house. \n \nThe owner can still collect double rent from an opponent who lands on the unimproved properties of his complete color-group. \n \nFollowing the above rules, a player may buy and erect at any time as many houses as his judgment and financial standing will allow. But \nhe must build evenly (i.e.: he cannot erect more than one house on any one property of any color-group until he has built one house on \nevery property of that group. He may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property. For \nexample, he cannot build three houses on one property if he has only one house on another property of that group.). \n \nAs a player builds evenly, he must also break down evenly if he sells houses back to the Bank (SEE SELLING PROPERTY). \n \nHOTELS...When a player has four houses on each property of a complete color-group, he may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect it on \nany property of that color-group. He returns the four houses from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as shown on \nthe Title Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one property.  \n \nBUILDING SHORTAGE...When the Bank has no houses to sell, players wishing to build must wait for some player to turn back or to \nsell his houses to the Bank before building.",

If there are a limited number of houses and hotels available, and two or more players wish to \nbuy more than the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the highest bidder. \n \nSELLING PROPERTY... Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities (but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private \ntransaction for any amount that the owner can get. However, no property can be sold to another player if buildings are standing on any \nproperties of that color-group. Any buildings so located must be sold back to the Bank before the owner can sell any property of that \ncolor-group. \n \nHouses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-half the price paid for them. \nAll houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly, in reverse of the manner in which they were erected. \nAll hotels on one color-group may be sold at once. Or they may be sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly, in \nreverse of the manner in which they were erected. \n \nMORTGAGES...Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged \nall the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each \nTitle Deed card. \n \nNo rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the same group. \nIn order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest.

If his debt is to \nanother player, he must turn over to that player all that he has of value and retire from the game. In making this settlement, if he owns \nhouses or hotels, he must return these to the Bank in exchange for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid for them and this cash \nis given to the creditor. If he has mortgaged property he also turns this property over to his creditor but the new owner must at once pay \nthe Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the property. After the new owner does this, he may, at his \noption, pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn at which time he may lift the mortgage. If he holds property in this way \nuntil a later turn, he must pay the interest again when he lifts the mortgage. \n \nShould a player owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than he can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling his \nbuildings and mortgaging property, he must turn over all his assets to the Bank. In this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all \nproperty so taken, except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the game. The last player left in the game wins. \n \nMISCELLANEOUS...Money can only be loaned to a player by the Bank and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow \nfrom or lend money to another player.  \n \n \nRULES for a SHORT GAME (60 to 90 minutes of fun) There are three differences in rules for this \"Short Game\". \n \n1.

In this short game it is only necessary to have three houses (instead of four) on each lot of a complete color-group before the player may \nbuy a hotel. \n \nRent received for a hotel remains the same as in the regular game. \n \nThe turn-in value of a hotel is still one-half the purchase price, which in this game is one house less than in the regular game. \n \n3. END OF GAME. The first player to go bankrupt retires from the game as in the regular game. However, when the second bankruptcy \noccurs the game ends. Play immediately ceases with the bankrupt player turning over to his creditor all that he has of value, including \nbuildings and any other properties-whether the creditor happens to be a rival player or the Bank. \n \nEach remaining player then values his property and cash on hand (2.) lots, utilities and railroads owned by him at the price printed on the \nboard; (3.) any mortgaged property owned by him at one-half price printed on the board; (4.) houses, valued at purchase price; (5.) hotels, \nvalued at the purchase price including the value of the three houses turned in. \n \nRICHEST PLAYER WINS! \n \nMARCA REGISTRADA,PARKER BROTHERS TRADE-MARK, FOR ITS REAL ESTATE TRADING GAME EQUIPMENT \n\u00a91935, 1936, 1947, 1951, 1952, 1954, 1961, 1973, PARKER BROTHERS DIV.
