Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be \ufb01ne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeci\ufb01c architecture modi\ufb01cations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018).",

These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce \ufb01ne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream tasks: feature-based and \ufb01ne-tuning. The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\net al., 2018a), uses task-speci\ufb01c architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\ntional features. The \ufb01ne-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\ntask-speci\ufb01c parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply \ufb01ne-tuning all pre-\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\ncially for the \ufb01ne-tuning approaches. The ma-\njor limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\ntectures that can be used during pre-training.",

For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\nand could be very harmful when applying \ufb01ne-\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\nporate context from both directions.\nIn this paper, we improve the \ufb01ne-tuning based\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\nrectionality constraint by using a \u201cmasked lan-\nguage model\u201d (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).

In addi-\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\na \u201cnext sentence prediction\u201d task that jointly pre-\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Un-\nlike Radford et al.

To train sentence representations, prior\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\ntence words given a representation of the previous\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\nsearch along a different dimension.

A \u201csequence\u201d refers to the in-\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The \ufb01rst\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\nsi\ufb01cation token ( [CLS]). The \ufb01nal hidden state\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\ngregate sequence representation for classi\ufb01cation\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence A or sentence B.

This step\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\nstandard conditional language models can only be\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\ndirectly \u201csee itself\u201d, and the model could trivially\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\nformer is often referred to as a \u201cTransformer encoder\u201d while\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a \u201cTransformer\ndecoder\u201d since it can be used for text generation.\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a \u201cmasked\nLM\u201d (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\ncase, the \ufb01nal hidden vectors corresponding to the\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\nstructing the entire input.\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\n\ufb01ne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\npear during \ufb01ne-tuning.",

To mitigate this, we do\nnot always replace \u201cmasked\u201d words with the ac-\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time.

Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing \u201cNo NSP\u201d to \u201cLTR & No NSP\u201d. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsigni\ufb01cantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\nboth left and right context at every layer.\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\non \ufb01ne-tuning task accuracy.",

The core argument of this\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\nwe do note that there are several other differences\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\n\u2022 GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\nwords).\n\u2022 GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP]) and\nclassi\ufb01er token ( [CLS]) which are only in-\ntroduced at \ufb01ne-tuning time; BERT learns\n[SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed-\ndings during pre-training.",

Our task-speci\ufb01c\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

Question: Does BERT really need such\na large amount of pre-training (128,000\nwords/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve\nhigh \ufb01ne-tuning accuracy?\nAnswer: Yes, BERT BASE achieves almost\n1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when\ntrained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\n2.
